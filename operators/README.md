# ISNOT operator
The ISNOT operator can be used in rules to check if two string values are not the same (the opposite of the IS operaror).

Example
```
IF mylabel.color ISNOT #006400 THEN ......
```
The ISNOT operator has been merged into the main V7 development version, so there is no need to install it from here anymore
